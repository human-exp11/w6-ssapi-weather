Weather Dashboard

***Weather Dashboard***

I created a Weather Dashboard using 

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city


## Completed Steps:

* Created my own API Key using the Open Weather API webpage
* Utilized two different API's to create both current and future weather conditions specific to the city searched
* Utilized both BootStrap and JQuery to create my HTML and styling
* Traversed the DOM to refer to specific code 
* Utilized a forloop to call upon data related to the 5-Day Forecast
* Created  a function to call previous city data from local storage
* Created a button for each previous city that would then take the user back to the city's data
* Created README file with link & screenshot
